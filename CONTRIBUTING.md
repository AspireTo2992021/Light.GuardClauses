You thought of an assertion that you'd like to add to Light.GuardClauses? That's awesome! Here is how you can add your ideas to the project:

1. **Create an issue**: before doing anything else, please create an issue where you describe what you have in mind. This way you and I can discuss and coordinate the implementation of your idea.
2. **Get the source code**: fork and clone the repository. Get accustomed to the way Light.GuardClauses is structured and how the functional and performance tests are written. Please use the same style guide as the rest of the source code.
3. **Create a branch for each feature**: besides the actual implementation, each feature should be tested functionally (in the Light.GuardClauses.Tests project) and performance-wise (in the Light.GuardClauses.Performance project).
4. **Send me a pull request for each feature**: please keep your pull requests as small as possible. Don't put two or more features in the same pull request. I think small pull requests take considerably less time to evaluate.
